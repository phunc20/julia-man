## Some Basic Usages
- `using`
  - To `using` multiple packages, separate them by commas: `using Pluto, PlutoUI, Flux, DifferentialEquations`
- repeat REPL's/notebook cells' last output: Unlike Python's `_`, Julia uses **`ans`**.
- comment code
  ```julia
  # Single-line comment
  #=
  Multi-
  line
  comment
  =#
  ```
