## Good Tutos

  - Actually, you can read the Julia docs offline! For example, on Linux, go to
    the folder that you have downloaded and extracted from Julia's official website
    (e.g. I have put mine under `.local/bin/julia-1.7.1/`). Inside that directory,
    one can find `share/doc/julia/html/en/index.html`. Then just open your browser
    and type in the URL to that directory/HTML file and you're good to go.


## Todo
01. Julia's plot for Dark Reader
02. Make environment easier for users of this repo. More concretely,
  - If keep `~/.config/julia/projects/oft/`, then at least put it in some `constant.jl` file and call it.
  - If not to keep it, try to make sth like a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file in Python, to allow reproduction of the environment.
