## Todo
01. Julia's plot for Dark Reader
02. Make environment easier for users of this repo. More concretely,
  - If keep `~/.config/julia/projects/oft/`, then at least put it in some `constant.jl` file and call it.
  - If not to keep it, try to make sth like a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file in Python, to allow reproduction of the environment.
